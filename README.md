simple script to launch tor using a bash script on linux... for future purposes

# how to use
* root yourself: `sudo su`
* install git: `pkg install git` or `apt install git` or `sudo install git` (it should be one of these)
* clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com?CPScript/Tor-launcher`
* run script: `bash launcher.sh`
